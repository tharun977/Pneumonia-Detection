## Project Overview

This project uses FastAI and Django to create an API that accepts chest X-ray images and returns a prediction of whether the image indicates pneumonia. The model is exported from FastAI and loaded into a Django REST Framework backend to serve predictions.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pneumonia-detection-api.git
cd pneumonia-detection-api
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add your pre-trained model
Place your exported FastAI model (e.g., `exported_model.pkl`) in the `models/` directory.

### 5. Run migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Start the server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Usage

You can use the API by sending a POST request to the `/predict/` endpoint with an image file of a chest X-ray.

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "image=@path/to/your/xray_image.jpg" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/predict/
```

The response will contain the predicted label (`Pneumonia` or `Normal`) and the confidence score.

## API Endpoints

### `/api/predict/`
- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: Accepts an image of a chest X-ray and returns the prediction (Pneumonia/Normal) with confidence score.
- **Request**:
  - `image`: The chest X-ray image to analyze (JPEG/PNG format).
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "prediction": "Pneumonia",
    "confidence": 0.95
  }
  ```

## Model Information

This project uses a pre-trained model saved as `exported_model.pkl` using FastAI. The model was trained to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

### How to train the model
To train a similar model, follow these steps:
1. Collect and preprocess the chest X-ray dataset.
2. Use FastAI to build and train the model.
3. Export the model using the `learn.export()` method.
